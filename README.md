    RESTful Api in GO
    <hr>
    Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style used for designing web services, and RESTful APIs have become a ubiquitous approach to building APIs. RESTful APIs are widely used by various organizations and applications, from social media platforms to e-commerce sites. Golang, also known as Go, is a powerful and efficient programming language that has gained increasing popularity for building RESTful APIs.

Get ready to read the word Go a lot!

## Introduction
Go is a new programming language built by Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer and Ken Thompson. It's a statically typed language with a gargabe collector and a kickass native concurrent-style programming model.

Go is mainly about three things:
* **Go is about composition**. It is *kind* of objected oriented just not in the usual way. There are no classes(but methods can be defined on any type), no subtype inheritance and interfaces are satisfied implicitly(we have structural typing). This results in simple pieces connected by small interfaces.
* **Go is about concurrency**. Go provides [CSP-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) concurrency primitives, it has lightweight threads called goroutines and typed thread-safe communication and synchronization with channels. This results in comprehensible concurrent code.
